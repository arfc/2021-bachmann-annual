\section{Results}

The results include the time-dependent resources required 
for each of the transition scenarios described. This includes 
the number of reactors, mass of enriched uranium, and the 
\gls{SWU} capacity needed to produce the enriched uranium.

Figure \ref{fig:energy} shows the total electricity output 
for each of the simulated scenarios.
