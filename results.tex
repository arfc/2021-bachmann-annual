\section{Results}

The results include the time-dependent resources required 
for each of the transition scenarios described. Resource requirements
of interest include the annual mass of enriched uranium required by 
the scenario (at each enrichment level), the amount of 
\gls{SWU} required to meet the annual product requirement, the amount 
of \gls{HEU} required for downblending to meet annual fuel requirements, 
and the rate of reactor deployment to meet the 
electricity demand of the scenario. Each of these resources will help
to determine an optimal way to meet \gls{HALEU} fuel demand for each 
scenario.
