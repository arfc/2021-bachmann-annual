\section{Expected Results}

The results of this work will include the resources required 
for each of the transition scenarios described. Resource requirements
of interest include the annual mass of enriched uranium required by 
the scenario (at each enrichment level), the amount of 
\gls{SWU} required to meet the annual product requirement, the amount 
of \gls{HEU} required for downblending to meet annual fuel requirements, 
and the number of reactors to be deployed at each time step to meet the 
electricity demand of the scenario. Each of these resources will help
to determine an optimal way to meet \gls{HALEU} fuel demand for each 
scenario. 

The resource requirements of each of the transition scenarios will 
be compared to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each 
scenario. It is expected that transition scenarios with the X-Energy 
Xe-100 \textsuperscript{TM} will have a more even profile of resource 
requirements with respect to time than the scenrios that deploy the 
\gls{USNC} \gls{MMR}\textsuperscript{TM} reactor due to the refueling 
schedule for the reactors.
