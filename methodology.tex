\section{Methodology}

This work simulates multiple fuel cycle scenarios using \Cyclus, an 
agent-based fuel cycle simulator \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
The agent-based architecture of \Cyclus allows for the simulation to treat
each facility discretely, including in how they are deployed and 
decommissioned \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}.



The first scenario simulated is the current fleet of U.S. reactors. This 
simulation begins in Jnauary 1965 and lasts through December 2045 (85 
years in total). Information about individaul reactors was obtained 
from the 2020 Year-end Reactor Status Report of the \gls{IAEA} \gls{PRIS} 
database \cite{noauthor_power_1989}. 
This database provids reactor type, rated power level, start-up, and 
shutdown dates for each of the commercial reactors in the U.S. Reactors 
that are still operational are assumed to operate for 60 years past the 
initial start date. Only reactors with a power level abov 400 MWe were 
used in the simulation, to remove reactors that are assumed to be research 
reactors.
