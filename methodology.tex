\section{Methodology}

Each fuel cycle scenario is simulated using \Cyclus, an 
agent-based fuel cycle simulator \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. 
The agent-based architecture of \Cyclus allows for the simulation to treat
each facility discretely, including their deployment and 
decommissioning \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. The \Cyclus 
Additional Modules Repository (the \Cycamore library) provides 
the archetypes for each of the facility agents deployed in the simulation.

The first scenario simulates the current fleet of U.S. reactors. This 
simulation begins in January 1965 and lasts through December 2050 (85 
years in total). The  \gls{IAEA} \gls{PRIS} database\cite{noauthor_power_1989},
from the 2020 
Year-end Reactor Status Report provided information about each reactor.
This database provides reactor type, rated power level, start-up, and 
shutdown dates for each of the commercial reactors in the U.S. reactor 
fleet
that are still operational (as of December 2020). All simulations assume 
the reactors operate for 60 years after their
initial start date if they have not already been shut down. Only reactors
with a power level above 400 MWe were 
used in the simulation to avoid including prototype and research reactors 
present in the database. Generic reactor core masses were obtained from 
\cite{todreas_nuclear_2012} and \cite{cacuci_handbook_2010}. 

Other fuel cycle facilities in the simulation include a uranium mine (to 
represent the Cameco Smith Ranch-Highland Mine), a uranium mill (to 
represent White Mesa Uranium Mill), a conversion facility (to represent 
the Honeywell Uranium Conversion Facility), an enrichment plant (to represent 
the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant), a fuel fabrication facility (to 
represent the Westinghouse Fuel Fabrication Facility), and various waste and 
spent fuel storage and disposal facilities (to represent Yucca Mountain). 
While there
are other fuel cycle facilities in the actual U.S. fuel cycle, this 
modeling provides a total of the resources required 
by each non-reactor step in the nuclear fuel cycle and simplifies the 
facilities that are not expected to be deployed or decommissioned often 
during the specified time frame. 

This work simulated the transition to a future with substantial \gls{HALEU} 
reactor deployment under two assumptions about growth in nuclear energy 
demand: one assuming no growth and the other assuming 1\% annual growth.  
These scenarios used the same  
non-reactor facilities as in the simulation of the current 
U.S. fuel cycle. \gls{HALEU} fuel reactors 
considered in this work include the \gls{USNC} \gls{MMR} \textsuperscript{TM}
\cite{mitchell_usnc_2020} and the X-Energy Xe-100 \textsuperscript{TM} 
Reactor \cite{harlan_x-energy_2018}\cite{hussain_advances_2018}. Both of 
these reactors are designed 
to use \gls{HALEU} fuel in the form of \gls{TRISO} fuel pebbles. Table 
\ref{tab:reactor_summary} summarizes the design of these two reactors.

We selected these two reactors because they have a high 
likelihood of being deployed and because published information is 
available about their designs. Comparing the transitional \gls{HALEU} 
demands of these reactors will also inform the fuel cycle support 
implications of deploying reactors with long cycle 
times versus those utilizing online refueling. 

Each of the transition scenarios will be simulated using a single type of 
advanced reactor, resulting in four additional fuel cycle scenarios and five 
scenarios in total. Each of the scenarios will be analyzed using Cymetric
\cite{scopatz_cymetric_2015} to determine the resource requirements of the 
scenario.
