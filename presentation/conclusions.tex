    \frametitle{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transitions to the \gls{USNC} \gls{MMR}\textsuperscript{TM}
              have significantly more material requirements than transitions to 
              the X-Energy Xe-100
        \item Changing to a 1\% growth demand model requires 
              advanced reactors to be deployed 2 years earlier
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Ongoing Work}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Incorporate \gls{LWR} license expiration dates
            \item Increase the amount of time in the scenario, change end date to 3025
            \item Use both \gls{HALEU}-fueled reactors in the same scenario
            \item Include non-\gls{HALEU}-fueled advanced reactors
        \end{itemize}
