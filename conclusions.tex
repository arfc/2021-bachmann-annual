\section{Ongoing Work}
Further work still needs to be done to complete the anlysis 
of these fuel cycle scenarios. Characteristics of the 
\gls{DRE} must be further investigated and adjsuted to 
ensure that required power levels are met. The transition 
scenarios assuming 1\% growth in energy demand must be 
simulated and analyzed.
